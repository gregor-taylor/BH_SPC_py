# Beckr-Hickl_SPC_for_Python
Wrappings of the SPC DLLs for Beckr and Hickl SPC cards.
Not tested or complete as of 11/07/19

Update: Requires the DLL from B&H which I assumed was included when you purchase the cards and software. 
Turns out it's not and you need to pay more for the DLLs. Will update this if we go that route, as a minimum this project needs:</br>
- Update the data structures from the SPCM_def.h file</br>
